								<h3>Your Lifestyle. Your Workout.</h3>
							</header>
							<p>There are many competing philosophies on the “best” way to workout. With Reba, the answer is simple:
								whatever workout fits you. Because your body and lifestyle is unique, your fitness program will be tailored to you. Being fit doesn’t
								mean starving and subjecting yourself to brutal sweat sessions. At Kinetic Spark Fitness, you can be fit by challenging your body to
								do a little better each day, sticking with your goals, and adopting a healthier lifestyle.</p>

								<h3>Train Smarter, Not Harder</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the past, weight loss programs drilled that you needed long hours of cardio to burn fat. With the latest research, we now know that we can train smarter—not harder—to achieve better results. By incorporating high intensity exercise in your workout, we’ll combine strength training and anaerobic exercise to burn more calories in less time. Other benefits? Your metabolism will be elevated for 72 hours after you workout, and you’ll simultaneously burn fat while building muscle.</p>

								<h3>Live Life in Motion</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The day-to-day monotony of life may seem harmless, but the hours we spend sitting at a desk, waiting in traffic, or lounging in front of a TV can lead to limp muscles and increased fat. With Reba’s help you can learn to live your life in motion with a few simple adjustments to your daily routine. By setting aside a few hours a week to train smart at Kinetic Spark Fitness, you can achieve your goals, combat your weaknesses, and enhance life outside of our fitness studio.</p>
