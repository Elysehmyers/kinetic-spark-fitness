										<h3>What is a Functional Aging Specialist?</h3>
										<hr />
										<div class="accordion-item-text hide">
											<p>
												A functional aging specialist is equipped to come alongside individuals who are feeling challenged to gain and maintain their fitness as their bodies change with age. There are many ways these adults can minimize the difficulty of these changes through exercise and special movements!

										<h3>What is a Cancer Exercise Training Specialist?</h3>
										<hr />
										<div class="accordion-item-text hide">
											<p>
												A cancer exercise specialist is uniquely qualified to work with cancer patients from diagnoses, after surgery and/or through survivorship. The Cancer Exercise Specialist Institute <em>(CETI)</em> emphasises individualized programming because we know that no two cancer patients are the same, and their exercise program should be as indivudal as they are.

										<h3>Can you write a weight loss diet for me?</h3>
										<hr />
										<div class="accordion-item-text hide">
											<p>
												Reba can give you guidance for eating healthier and achieving your goals. In California, personal trainers are not licensed to write a prescribed diet plan for you, but can refer you to a holistic nutritionist or help you find a registered dietitian. Kinetic Spark Fitness will always refer to a medical professional if there is a condition outside the scope of strength and conditioning or personal training.

										<h3>Can my trainer help me rehabilitate an injury?</h3>
										<hr />
										<div class="accordion-item-text hide">
											<p>
												Reba is not a physical therapist, but she is trained and experienced in post-rehabilitation exercise. Working with her after rehabilitation will help maintain and improve the results you achieve with your physical therapist. If you have an injury that still needs rehabilitation, Kinetic Spark Fitness will refer you to a qualified medical professional in the Santa Clarita valley.

										<h3> How can I get the most out of my training session?</h3>
										<hr />
										<div class="accordion-item-text hide">
											<p>
												Remember that you deserve the best, both from your trainer and from yourself. Come dressed in sensible workout clothing that is comfortable to move in. Occasionally your trainer may have you do exercises in socks or bare feet to encourage sensory-motor integration, but to be safe, always bring some cross training shoes.
											</p>
											<p>
												Some people may exercise well on an empty stomach while others need to eat a small meal about 45 minutes prior to working out. This depends on your individual metabolism and level of comfort; talk to your trainer to find out what’s right for you.

						<h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>
					</header>
					<p class="quote">
						"As a trainer, Reba is extremely knowledgeable about anatomy and physiology and takes the time to explain how things work together. I know that I can get sloppy with my form and she watches my every move to ensure that the intended muscles are doing the work. Certain days, things just are not working as they should. She does not push me, but also does not let me slide. She finds another way to accomplish the same exercise. When I first went to her, I had some physical limitations, and she was always very aware and trained me smartly so as not to injure myself.  Reba has goals for her clients and she works hard to achieve those goals, but always pain free. She is very passionate about her work and I can tell that she takes great pride in my success!"
