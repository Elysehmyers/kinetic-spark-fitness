									The media and the medical community wisely tell us that getting exercise is really important for our health and well-being – Especially as we get older. But what kind of exercise is safe for someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer? Or is undergoing chemo? What about someone who has just been released from physical therapy after having a rotator cuff repair, or a knee or hip replacement? And are we every too old to exercise? It’s hard to know where to turn for appropriate exercise plan in light of medical conditions. It’s even harder to know where to start when exercise is new. It can be scary and intimidating! The last thing you’d want is to get hurt trying to improve your health!
								</p>
								<p>
									Reba’s certifications in medical exercise, corrective exercise, cancer exercise and functional aging, as well as being a strength and conditioning coach, equip her to come alongside and help people with the questions that are holding them back. It’s time to not just “die older”, but enjoy LIVING longer. She understands that fitness and weight management are not always just about looking good in our clothes, nice as that might be. (Many of us aren’t necessarily aiming right now to become competitive bodybuilders or underwear models! That ship may have already sailed!) Rather, they are about moving throughout the day with stamina and confidence, and being able to participate in activities with friends and loved ones! It’s about continuing to LIVE and explore new possibilities as we age!

						<h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>
					</header>
					<p class="quote">
						"Reba at Kinetic Spark Fitness is as good as it gets. I have been training with her for approximately five years and will follow her forever. She has such a positive attitude and knows exactly what you need. Her credentials speak to how knowledgeable she is. No matter if you are a star athlete or a woman in her sixties, like myself, getting into mother of the bride readiness, she will whip you into shape with kindness. I love her and wouldn't go anywhere else."
